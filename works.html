    <h3>Visual Argument&#58 <q>The Real Costs of Consumerism</q></h3>

    <q>The Real Costs of Consumerism</q> is a Visual Argument meant to draw attention to the many
    negative environmental and societal effects of overconsumption in the current age. In the modern digital
    age, we are constantly presented with ads for incredibly cheap products from companies like Temu,
    Shein, and TikTok Shop. Not only are these products unethically sourced through inhumane labor
    practices, they inevitably end up in the garbage, creating an excess of waste in landfills that harms the
    environment through greenhouse gas emissions, groundwater contamination, habitat destruction, and
    many other detrimental effects. This piece aims to draw a stark contrast between the luxe, hyper-
    aestheticized conception of the consumer lifestyle and the real, dirty and damaging results of participating
    in such. Creating this piece was quite the challenge for me, as I have never worked with Gimp before. I spent
    many hours researching and watching tutorials to figure out how to complete the most basic movements
    in the software. I learned mostly from trial and error, trying out tools and hoping for the best. When the
    results weren&#39t what I intended, I started over. The final piece acts as a visually striking PSA, bringing to light the most detrimental side effects of consumerism, and encouraging viewers to learn more about the issue and take action.

<q>Sunday</q> is a soundscape narrative designed to emulate the sounds of a quiet Sunday morning. The piece is intended for casual listening and aims to create a peaceful, familiar ambiance and evoke feelings of tranquility and contentment in listeners. Listeners will be able to resonate with the mundane eb and flow found during a day of rest and find enjoyment in the simplicity of the sounds of the little things in life and routine. The creation of <q>Sunday</q> was an introduction to a new form of audio editing through Audacity, a program I have not used in the past. This process posed many challenges, as I had to relearn what I knew about audio editing and discover how to use familiar tools in a brand-new format. The finished piece is 3 minutes and 3 seconds long and consists of 5 audio tracks. Techniques and tools used include splitting, joining, cutting, and trimming clips, moving clips across tracks to allow for selective editing of audio gain, and using the envelope tool to fade in/ fade out and level audio within and across clips. Design choices were conscientiously made to create an easy-to-listen-to, cohesive, and tranquil soundscape that evokes the peaceful, familiar feelings of a Sunday morning.
