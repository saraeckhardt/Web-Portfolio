    <q>The Real Costs of Consumerism</q> is a Visual Argument meant to draw attention to the many
    negative environmental and societal effects of overconsumption in the current age. In the modern digital
    age, we are constantly presented with ads for incredibly cheap products from companies like Temu,
    Shein, and TikTok Shop. Not only are these products unethically sourced through inhumane labor
    practices, they inevitably end up in the garbage, creating an excess of waste in landfills that harms the
    environment through greenhouse gas emissions, groundwater contamination, habitat destruction, and
    many other detrimental effects. This piece aims to draw a stark contrast between the luxe, hyper-
    aestheticized conception of the consumer lifestyle and the real, dirty and damaging results of participating
    in such. Creating this piece was quite the challenge for me, as I have never worked with Gimp before. I spent
    many hours researching and watching tutorials to figure out how to complete the most basic movements
    in the software. I learned mostly from trial and error, trying out tools and hoping for the best. When the
    results weren&#39t what I intended, I started over. The final piece acts as a visually striking PSA, bringing to light the most detrimental side effects of consumerism, and encouraging viewers to learn more about the issue and take action.

<q>Sunday</q> is a soundscape narrative designed to emulate the sounds of a quiet Sunday morning. The piece is intended for casual listening and aims to create a peaceful, familiar ambiance and evoke feelings of tranquility and contentment in listeners. Listeners will be able to resonate with the mundane eb and flow found during a day of rest and find enjoyment in the simplicity of the sounds of the little things in life and routine. The creation of <q>Sunday</q> was an introduction to a new form of audio editing through Audacity, a program I have not used in the past. This process posed many challenges, as I had to relearn what I knew about audio editing and discover how to use familiar tools in a brand-new format. The finished piece is 3 minutes and 3 seconds long and consists of 5 audio tracks. Techniques and tools used include splitting, joining, cutting, and trimming clips, moving clips across tracks to allow for selective editing of audio gain, and using the envelope tool to fade in/ fade out and level audio within and across clips. Design choices were conscientiously made to create an easy-to-listen-to, cohesive, and tranquil soundscape that evokes the peaceful, familiar feelings of a Sunday morning.

    <q>Enlightenment</q> is a short film that explores themes of disillusionment, depression, isolation, sense of self, appreciation, spirituality, nature, and togetherness. The film follows an unnamed central female character unhappy with her drole, unfulfilling life, and her turn to spirituality to find the meaning she lacks. In her search for meaning through spiritual practice, she begins to better appreciate the world around her and understand her role in the Universe as a whole. <q>Enlightenment</q> reflects on the lived experiences of the director and other twenty-somethings alike, struggling to find meaning in a stage in life where many of us lose our way. 

The ambiguity of the single, unnamed central character with no explicit background is essential to the central idea of the film: that all people (and all of the Universe&#39s creations) exist as one, interconnected spiritual being. In better understanding her connection to the Universe, she comes to love herself. This ambiguity also allows audiences to better relate to the main character, as she exists as only a body in this medium, but a representation of the spirit of any one or all of us. 

Dim, unsaturated lighting with hues of purple and blue, along with unfocused video and ambient, static noise reflect the main character&#39s melancholy, detached outlook on life in the beginning scenes of the film. Growing humming and ringing noises come to an uncomfortably loud head in the middle of the film, symbolizing the character&#39s mounting frustration with her lifestyle and the ultimate realization that she must make a change. This uncomfortable loudness is boldly contrasted in the following scene which functions as a transition between the main character&#39s previous life and her life to come. The main character stands on her balcony in silent contemplation, distant birdsong and outdoor ambiance the only sounds to be heard. This scene is followed by scenes displaying the character&#39s journey into spirituality which include soothing, mystical music and ambient nature sounds with visual cut-ins of icons that represent some of the main pillars of spiritual thought: sacred knowledge, the prosperity of nature, the sun, the divine feminine, positivity, vitality, intuition, flow, and caring. Subsequent scenes showing the main character beginning to enjoy life are flooded with warm, yellow light, a strong symbol of renewal, awakening, and joy. 

The opening and closing scenes of <q>Enlightenment</q> are shot exactly the same, with the main character looking at herself in the mirror. The scenes greatly contrast one another, however, with the mood entirely shifting from sorrowful to joyous through the character&#39s demeanor supplemented by lighting and audio. This artistic choice allows the film to come full circle, representing the cyclical nature of life while also showing that great change is possible.

<p> <q>A New Perspective</q> was my first short film project. Given the prompt <q>turn something ugly into something beautiful,</q> <q>A New Perspective</q> was planned, shot, and edited in two weeks time. This film uses still shots of grafitti in some of the poorest nieghborhoods of Pittsburgh and transforms these pieces into living art. In showing the beauty in these works, the film showcases the inherent value found in all people and places on this Earth. In these stills, we can see that human creativity and artfulness knows no bounds, whatever the circumstance.
    The film aims viewers to appreciate and take stock in the disenfranchised and forgotten, as beauty exists in everyone and everything.
